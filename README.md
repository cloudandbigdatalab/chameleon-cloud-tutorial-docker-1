# Chameleon Cloud Docker Tutorial

This repo is contains the files for the Chameleon Cloud Docker tutorial. You can find all the Chameleon tutorials [here][tutorials]. In this tutorial we're going to guide you through the fundamentals of using Docker on Chameleon Cloud. You should already be familiar with managing resources on Chameleon Cloud, if not follow the "Getting Started" tutorial.

## Prerequisites

It's expected that you have a general knowledge of Linux command-line environments, though most of the steps can be copied exactly without modification. No previous knowledge of Docker is required but this tutorial will not explain Docker concepts, only how to implement them on Chameleon. See the official Docker [docs](https://docs.docker.com/) for explanation of the concepts deployed in this tutorial.

## Steps

1. Spin up Chameleon resources
2. Setup first host with Postgres and ambassador containers
3. Setup second host with Nginx, uWSGI (Python), and ambassador containers
4. Test demo site to see if configuration was successful
