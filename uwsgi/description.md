This page is the result of an introductory tutorial of [Docker](https://www.docker.com) on [Chameleon Cloud](https://www.chameleoncloud.org). The tutorial shows how to configure an image using a Dockerfile, run applications inside containers, and how to link containers on the same and different hosts. Two baremetal Chameleon servers are used to run this page, one running containers with [Nginx](http://nginx.com) and [uWSGI](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) (Python), the other running [Postgres](http://www.postgresql.org). The list of cloud types below is pulled from the Postgres database to demonstrate the cross-host link. The tutorial is available [here](https://cloudandbigdatalab.github.io).
